# Required Features:
- Create a new token on Solana testnet, for example, MOVE token.
- Create a smart contract to swap SOL to MOVE token, for each SOL swapped we will receive 10 MOVE (the price is a constant).
- Create a UI to swap or create a script to execute to send swap transaction to Solana testnet

# Technical requirements:
- Use Git and commit often
- Have unit test for that contract
- Smart contract have to be deployed to Solana testnet and execute successfully
